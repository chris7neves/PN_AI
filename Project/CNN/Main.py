# This file will allow the user to define different sets of         #
# hyperparameters to use for different network architectures.       #
# This file will not build the network, it will accept user defined #
# parameters and call NetworkFactory to build and train the desired #
# architectures. This file will also display the results and        #
# performance metrics of the various defined networks.              #
